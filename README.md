This assignment was difficult at first and I definitely had to go through the lecture a few times to fully grasp the concept of event listeners. However, by the time I got to the custom branch, it was cool to find some new listener types and play around with them. This made the assignment enjoyable and it's always exciting when your function works the way it should. :)
